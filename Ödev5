Angular Nedir?
Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript.
*Angular Architecture
Root Module => Angular App
                Modules  =>   Render the view in the browseer
    Components           Services(Business logic)
HTML      Classes       

Typescript Nedir?   
TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.
let firstName = "Dylan"; // inferred to type string => typescript knows Dylan is a string
--------------------------------------------
Reference Type-Value Type

const one=1;
const oneCopy=1;

console.log(one===oneCopy); //true

const arr1=[1];
const arr2=[1];

console.log(arr1===arr2); //false
 
Value types in ts => number, string, boolean 
Reference types in ts => arrays, functions, objects
-----------------------------------------
Stack Heap
⦁	Stack is a linear data structure whereas Heap is a hierarchical data structure.
⦁	Stack memory will never become fragmented whereas Heap memory can become fragmented as blocks of memory are first allocated and then freed.
⦁	Stack accesses local variables only while Heap allows you to access variables globally.
⦁	Stack variables can’t be resized whereas Heap variables can be resized.
⦁	Stack memory is allocated in a contiguous block whereas Heap memory is allocated in any random order.
⦁	Stack doesn’t require to de-allocate variables whereas in Heap de-allocation is needed.
⦁	Stack allocation and deallocation are done by compiler instructions whereas Heap allocation and deallocation is done by the programmer.
